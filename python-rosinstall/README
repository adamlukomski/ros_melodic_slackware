python-rosinstall

Command-line tools for maintaining a workspace of projects from
multiple version-control systems, tailored for the ROS
(Robot operating system) community.

Using rosinstall you can update several folders using a variety
of SCMs (SVN, Mercurial, git, Bazaar) with just one command.
The rosinstall package provides a Python API for interacting with
a source code workspace as well as a group of command line tools.
Rosinstall leverages the vcstools package for source control
and stores its state in .rosinstall files.
