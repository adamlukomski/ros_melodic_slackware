ros-melodic-desktop

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework
for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools,
libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task
of creating complex and robust robot behavior across
a wide variety of robotic platforms.

This is a script that will download a specific version
of the ROS Melodic Desktop framework, apply Slackware-specific
patches and create a single package.

Please note there is still a trick used that links lib to lib64
on 64-bit systems for compatibility (patch in progress). This
is only required for plugin system as the paths are
hard-coded in plugins.xml.

By default omits wstool and downloads everything from the
.rosinstall file using wget. This is done because of a hiccup
in wstool and the naming of directories inside .tar.gz.
To get back to wstool please use:

USE_WGET=no ./ros-melodic-desktop.SlackBuild
